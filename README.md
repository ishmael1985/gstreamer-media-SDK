GST-MFX
==============
GStreamer plugins for Intel&reg; Media SDK


Overview
--------
GST-MFX consists of a collection of GStreamer plugins for Intel&reg; Media SDK (MSDK).
This allows users to use MSDK in their GStreamer-based applications with minimal knowledge of 
the MSDK API.

GST-MFX includes plugins to perform decode, encode, video postprocessing (VPP)
and high performance rendering. Please refer to README.USAGE for more information about these
plugins and their usage.


Features
--------
 - Decode H264 AVC, MPEG-2, JPEG, VC-1, HEVC (Main and Main 10), VP8 and VP9 (including Profile 2 10-bit) videos
 - Compatible with GStreamer-based video players such as Totem, Parole and gst-play
   through playbin element.
 - Support for zero-copy rendering with glimagesink using EGL (Linux) or DirectX 11 / OpenGL interop (Windows)
 - Support for Direct3D 11 on Windows with zero-copy and HDR support for 10-bit video formats
 - Support native Wayland rendering using Wayland backend
 - Support X11 rendering using DRI3 backend
 - Support VPP acceleration of dynamic procamp control during video playback
 - Support for subtitles (text overlay) via MFX VPP surface composition
 - Support all Media SDK postprocessing capabilities as exposed by the MSDK API
 - Encode / transcode video into H.264, HEVC (Main and Main 10), MPEG-2 and JPEG formats


Requirements
------------

**Software requirements**

  * Intel&reg; Media SDK 2016 R2 / 2017 R1 for Windows or

    DirectX 11 (Windows 8 / 8.1 / 10)

**Hardware requirements**

Compiling
---------
GST-MFX uses the Meson and Ninja build tools for building and installation.
You can install the latest meson and ninja packages using the pip installer program generally bundled with recent Python 3 installer packages.
This can be done via the following command (sudo privileges may be required on Linux systems):

	pip3 install --upgrade meson ninja

On Windows, you will need to setup pkg-config and add to PATH.
You can get pkg-config from here (https://sourceforge.net/projects/pkgconfiglite/files/).
Then open VS x64 native tools command prompt, and add gstreamer pkgconfig path to PKG_CONFIG_PATH if not already done:

	set PKG_CONFIG_PATH=%GSTREAMER_1_0_ROOT_X86_64%lib\pkgconfig

When building against the open-source Media SDK stack (https://github.com/Intel-Media-SDK/MediaSDK), please ensure that the MSDK pkgconfig files
installed in custom build paths are included in the PKG_CONFIG_PATH. For example,

	export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/intel/mediasdk/lib/pkgconfig/

To setup a release build and install to the GStreamer system installation directory,
run the following Meson command to configure the out-of-source build:

	meson ../gst-mfx-build_release --prefix=${PREFIX} --libdir=${LIBDIR} --buildtype=release

Typically, ${PREFIX} would be `/usr` in Linux or `C:\gstreamer\1.0\x86_64` in Windows,
and ${LIBDIR} would be `lib64` (Fedora and related derivatives), `lib/x86_64-linux-gnu` (Ubuntu and related derivatives),
or `lib` (Windows).
	
To setup a VS2015 project:

	meson ..\gst-mfx-build_msvc --backend=vs2015
		
Newer platforms such as Skylake and Kabylake have added video codec support such as HEVC decode / encode and VP9 decode,
but are disabled by default to maximize compatibility with older systems such as Baytrail and Haswell.
To enable these features such as HEVC encode and VP9 decode support, you can do the following:

	meson ../gst-mfx-build --prefix=${PREFIX} --libdir=${LIBDIR} -DMFX_H265_ENCODER=true -DMFX_VP9_DECODER=true

For a list of more options when configuring the build, refer to the meson_options.txt file inside the source directory.

Next step is to build and install the GST-MFX plugins:

	cd ../gst-mfx-build
	ninja
	sudo ninja install

To uninstall the plugins:

	sudo ninja uninstall

DirectX-OpenGL interoperability is supported when building with minGW. To build it with MSVC,
add GL/glext.h and GL/wglext.h to the build, add `#if GST_GL_HAVE_PLATFORM_EGL ... #endif` to gstreamer-1.0\gst\gl\glprototypes\eglimage.h and
comment out `and cc.has_header('GL/glext.h')` in meson.build. A more system-specific workaround would be to put the headers to
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.1\Include\um\gl` to avoid having to modify meson.build.


Usage
-----
Please refer to README.USAGE for examples on how to accomplish various
video-related tasks with the GST-MFX plugins.

Known Issues
------------
 - Threading issues especially with tee and queue elements. Refer to README.USAGE for more details on these issues
 and the workarounds currently required to resolve them.
 - Resizing the glimagesink window while rendering a video using the DX11 - OpenGL interop feature causes the video to freeze,
 but playback continues normally. This is a GstGL bug that is not observed in GStreamer versions 1.10.5 and 1.12.2.
 - Auto-deinterlacing of H264 mixed interlaced videos during decoding does not work correctly prior to version 1.11.90.
 Since then, h264parse has been fixed to autodetect such videos before initializing the decoder.

Acknowledgements
----------------
This project is heavily based on the well-established GStreamer VAAPI architecture, hence we would
like to publicly thank the GStreamer VAAPI developers for their hard work and contributions.
